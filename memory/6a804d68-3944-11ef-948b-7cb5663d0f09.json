        "Make a chatbot using langchain?",
        "To create a chatbot using LangChain, you can follow these steps:\n\n**Step 1: Import necessary modules**\n```python\nfrom langchain_community.chat_models import ChatOpenAI\nfrom langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage\n```\n**Step 2: Initialize the chat model**\n```python\nchat = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-4\", max_tokens=256, temperature=0.75)\n```\n**Step 3: Define a function to handle user input**\n```python\ndef handle_user_input(user_input: str) -> str:\n    # Create a HumanMessage object\n    message = HumanMessage(content=user_input)\n    # Invoke the chat model\n    response = chat.invoke([message])\n    # Return the response\n    return response.generated_text\n```\n**Step 4: Test the chatbot**\n```python\nuser_input = \"Hello, how are you?\"\nresponse = handle_user_input(user_input)\nprint(response)\n```\nThis is a basic example of creating a chatbot using LangChain. You can customize the chat model, add more functionality, and integrate it with other LangChain components to create a more sophisticated chatbot.\n\nDo you have any specific questions about this example or LangChain in general?"

        "Hey add loop so that it can run continuestionly",
        "To make the script run continuously, you can add a `while True` loop around the main logic of the script. This will cause the script to run indefinitely until it is manually stopped.\n\nHere's an example of how you can modify the script:\n```bash\nwhile true\ndo\n    # Your script logic here\n    startGraphDB &\n    waitGraphDBStart\n    loadData\n    wait\n\n    # Main Loop\n    ...\ndone\n```\nThis will cause the script to start GraphDB, wait for it to start, load the data, and then enter the main loop. The main loop will run indefinitely until the script is manually stopped.\n\nNote that you may want to add some error handling or a way to exit the loop cleanly if needed.\n\nAlso, if you want to run the script in the background, you can add an `&` at the end of the command, like this:\n```bash\nwhile true\ndo\n    # Your script logic here\n    startGraphDB &\n    waitGraphDBStart\n    loadData\n    wait\n\n    # Main Loop\n    ...\ndone &\n```\nThis will run the script in the background, and you can use `fg` command to bring it to the foreground if needed.\n\nLet me know if you have any further questions!"
